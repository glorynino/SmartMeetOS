Alex: Okay team, thanks for joining. We need to wrap up the website redesign by Friday.

Jordan: I’ve finished the homepage layout, but I’m still waiting on the brand assets from the marketing folder in Notion.

Alex: I'll ping the marketing team on Discord right after this call to get those assets.

Sam: Also, we need to schedule a formal review with the stakeholders. Does next Tuesday at 2:00 PM work for everyone?

Jordan: Tuesday works for me.

Alex: Perfect, Sam, please add that to the Google Calendar and invite the lead designer.

Sam: Will do. One last thing—the documentation for the API is currently scattered. We should consolidate that into the "Technical Specs" page in Notion by end of day.
